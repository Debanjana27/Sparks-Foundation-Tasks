<h2>Australia</h2> Woomera
<br>
Latitude 31.1<sup>o</sup> S Longitude 136.8<sup>o</sup> E
<br><br>
In 1967, a U.S. Redstone rocket carried the Australian science satellite, WRESAT, to orbit from Woomera. That made Australia the fourth nation in the world &ndash; after the USSR, the U.S. and France &ndash; to place in Earth orbit a satellite launched from its own territory. In 1971, Great Britain became the sixth nation to launch an artificial moon to orbit above Earth. The science satellite Prospero, also named Black Knight 1, rode atop a British rocket called Black Arrow in a launch from Woomera. No further satellites have been launched from Woomera, and most of the rocket range equipment has been destroyed or sold off for scrap. However, the pads at Woomera compose something new called <a href="http://www.asicc.com.au/">Spaceport Australia</a>. The Australian Space Council is planning for launches from Woomera as well as from Darwin and the Cape York Peninsula. Sparsely populated Woomera has some infrastructure, is usually cloud free, and would be a good location for access to polar orbits.

The <a href="http://www.army.forces.gc.ca/">Canadian Army</a> conducted the first series of rocket firings at Fort Churchill in 1954. During International Geophysical Year (IGY) 1957-58, Canada and the U.S. built the Churchill Range to launch suborbital <a href="http://pao.gsfc.nasa.gov/gsfc/lithos/srockets/srockets.htm">sounding rockets</a> to probe the upper atmosphere. On November 8, 1958, a Nike-Cajun sounding rocket was launched from Churchill with the first Canadian science payload.  Some 200 Aerobie and Nike Cajun sounding rockets were launched during IGY. On September 5, 1959, launch at the Churchill Range of the first truly Canadian sounding rocket, the Black Brant 1, built at Winnipeg, Manitoba. More than 3,500 suborbital flights took off from the range through 1989. Churchill was disadvantaged by its location, which limited research to only one kind of aurora. Most Northern Lights sounding rocket flights were relocated to <a href="#PokerFlat">Poker Flat Research Range</a> in Alaska, which offered broad auroral research. Black Brants also were launched from <a href="http://www.seathelights.com/nb/equoddy.html">East Quoddy</a> in New Brunswick to probe changes in the upper atmosphere during solar eclipses in 1970 and 1972. Akjuit Aerospace Corp. would like to redevelop the Churchill Rocket and Research Range as <i>SpacePort Canada,</i> the worldÂ¹s first commercial polar spaceport. It would have three launch pads capable of sending medium-size satellites to orbit. In 1996, Russia agreed to launch its Start rockets from Churchill, but the market for space launches dropped and plans are on hold.

On April 24, 1970, the <a href="/China/China.html">Peoples Republic of China</a> became the Fifth nation to launch an artificial moon to orbit above Earth. The satellite was named Mao-1.  It rode atop a rocket called Long March-1 in a launch from <a href="http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200310/14/eng20031014_125965.shtml">Jiuquan Space Launch Center</a> in Inner Mongolia. Today, China has <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-10/15/content_272334.htm">three main spaceports</a>. Jiuquan Space Launch Center was built north of Jiuquan City in the 1960s in the Gobi desert 1,000 miles west of Beijing, China. It was China's first launch site. Jiuquan was limited to southeastern launches into 57-70 degree orbits to avoid overflying Russia and Mongolia. Western nations had called this site Shuang Cheng Tzu. Long March space rockets and atmospheric sounding rockets are fired from Jiuquan. Jiuquan is used for recoverable Earth observation and microgravity missions. Due to the site's geographical location, most Chinese commercial flights take off from other spaceports. China launched to Earth orbit the piloted spacecraft Shenzhou 5 atop a Long March 2F rocket from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center on October 15, 2003. Inside the capsule was China's first astronaut, Yang Liwei. The flight made China the third nation able to send a man to space, following a trail blazed by Russia and the United States.

It was built 40 miles north of Xichang City in 1978. Its first launch was in 1984. Xichang launches Long March space rockets. The local population lives near the launch pads. When the first Long March 3B rocket crashed in 1996 on a hillside a mile from the launch pad, six persons were killed and 57 injured. When a Long March 2E exploded in 1995, debris killed six and injured 23 in a village five miles downrange.

It rode atop a rocket called Ariane in a launch from Kourou, French Guiana. Today, the European Space Agency fires space rockets from the Kourou space launch complex known as Centre Spatial Guyanais. CSG is owned by the French national space agency, CNES. It is used by the European Space Agency (ESA) and its commercial space launch arm Arianespace to blast ESA's Ariane rockets to space. CSG is one of the most favorable sites for launches of satellites to geostationary orbit. Kourou's position near the equator offers an advantage over Cape Canaveral for eastbound launches. French Guiana's coastline permits launches into both equatorial and polar Sun-synchronous orbits with inclinations up to 100.5<sup>o</sup>. Hundreds of sounding rockets and balloons and space satellites have been launches from Centre Spatial Guyanais.

Russia created the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in 1991 after the collapse of the Soviet Union (USSR). CIS is composed of twelve of the fifteen former Soviet republics, including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. <a href="http://www.russianspaceweb.com/kapyar.html">Kapustin Yar Cosmodrome</a> was the Soviet Union's first rocket development center. Its first launch was in 1947. During the early years, Kapustin Yar tested captured V2 missiles captured from the germans at the end of World War 2. The site also saw sounding rocket launches in the early years carrying dogs and other animals up to altitudes as high as 300 miles. Kapustin Yar Cosmodrome is known as the Volgograd Station to those who work there. The first orbital launch from Kapustin Yar was Cosmos 1 in 1962. Seventy space launches to orbit were carried out by 1980, mostly small Cosmos science satellites. The USSR switched its space launches to Plesetsk leaving Kapustin Yar to send up only occasional missions, usually for radar calibration. There have been no launches to orbit since 1987. Space launches from Kapustin Yar totaled 83. Today there are some missile testing activities as well as Cosmos suborbital launches. <a href="http://www.russianspaceweb.com/centers_industry_origin.html"><span class=tinyLink>[russian rocket history]</span></a>

<br><br>
On October 4, 1957, the U.S.S.R. became the first nation to loft an artificial moon to orbit above Earth. The satellite was named Sputnik 1.  It rode atop a rocket called Old Number Seven in a launch from <a href="http://www.russianspaceweb.com/baikonur.html">Baikonur Cosmodrome</a>. Missile and rocket launches began in the 1950s in the Baikonur/Tyuratam area of Kazakhstan in central Asia. The launch pad from which Sputnik 1 and Yuri Gagarin were launched was constructed in 1955. In 1957, the launch site was said to be near Tyuratam in Kazakhstan, about 230 miles southwest of Baikonur. However, the Soviet Union government tried to hide the location by reporting its latitude and longitude as the same as that for the town of Baikonur. Baikonur Cosmodrome actually is located at 45.6<sup>o</sup>N and 63.4<sup>o</sup>E. Kazakhstan finally renamed the launch site after the closer Tyuratam in 1992. However, the global space community still refers to it as Baikonur Cosmodrome. Baikonur is a large cosmodrome with nine launch complexes encompassing fifteen launch pads. All of Russia's manned space flights and interplanetary probes are launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Baikonur is the only cosmodrome launching Proton, Zenit, Energia and Tsyklon SL-11 space rockets. Launches headed due east would be the most efficient, but are not flown from Baikonur because lower stages of the rockets might fall into China.

In 1957, the first of several pads at <a href="http://www.russianspaceweb.com/plesetsk.html">Plesetsk Cosmodrome</a> for launches of the old R7 or A-class missiles-rockets were constructed in support of the USSR's then-infant intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) program. The pads and ICBM rockets moved to active duty in 1960. For a long time, Plesetsk Cosmodrome was the world's busiest spaceport. However, it eventually was overtaken by Baikonur as launch campaigns were transferred to newer space boosters at Tyuratam. Today, there are launch pads -- for Cosmos, Soyuz/Molniya Tsyklon and Zenit space boosters. Plesetsk Cosmodrome is located in Russia at 2.8<sup>o</sup>N and 40.1<sup>o</sup>E, which allows the launch of communications satellites and spy satellites to polar and highly elliptical orbits. Range safety restrictions limit flights from Plesetsk to 62.8<sup>o</sup>, 67.1<sup>o</sup>, 73-74<sup>o</sup>, 82-83<sup>o</sup>.

The Republic of South Africa has considered using Israel's Shavit space booster to send a satellite to orbit. The South Africans have tested the Israeli Jericho 2 intermediate-range ballistic missile which converts to the Shavit space rocket. South Africa could launch a satellite to space, firing it from the nation's southern area near Cape Town into the sky over either the Atlantic or Indian Ocean. However, the South African government has said it has the science and technology to launch a space satellite, but is not interested because of high costs. Pretoria has kept the pot boiling by setting up a committee to keep abreast of space technology and coordinate development.

On January 31, 1958, the United States became the second nation to launch an artificial moon to orbit above Earth. The satellite, Explorer 1, rode a Jupiter-C rocket from Cape Canaveral. Today, <a href="https://www.patrick.af.mil/45sw/ccafs/index.htm">Cape Canaveral Air Force Station</a> at <a href="https://www.patrick.af.mil/">Patrick Air Force Base</a>, Florida, is part of the U.S. Space Command <a href="https://www.patrick.af.mil/45sw/ccafs/index.htm">45th Space Wing</a>. Cape Canaveral has active Titan, Atlas and Delta launch
complexes. It provides facilities for military, NASA and commercial organizations. More than 500 space launches have been made from the Cape, including NASA's many manned missions. The annual launch rate is about 25 to 30 flights because the Cape was built in the1950s. Currently, Titan rockets are launched from pads 40 and 41, Delta from 17A and 17B, and Atlas Centaur from 36A and 36B. Orbital inclinations range up to to 57<sup>o</sup>. Polar launches from Canaveral are not permitted because they would have to fly over populated areas. The Cape's Eastern Range tracking network extends all the way into the Indian Ocean where it meets the Western Range network. Spaceport Florida Facility is a commercial launch site at Cape Canaveral Air Station operated by the Spaceport Florida Authority (SFA), a state agency. It converted the Navy's old Launch Complex 46 pad for firing small to medium commercial launch vehicles ferrying satellites to equatorial orbit.
